                    <p>
                        The Solar Panel of Tiers 1 is a simple generator. It's a Minecraft replica of the solar
                        panel. It can only generate power during the day with a direct sky access. The power
                        generated depends on the weather. (Generate less if rainy or stormy)

                        The Solar Panel of Tiers 2 is the same solar panel as the Tiers 1. The only differences are
                        the amount of ELs generated per tick and the maximum power capacity.

                        The Water Turbine is a hydrolic generator. It needs water to generate power. The water
                        source must be placed in front of the Paddle and there must be one air block in the back for
                        the water to flow out.

                        The Biomass Generator is a generator that takes your biomass and turns it into energy. If
                        you are a modmaker, you can add your own biomass with the tag <a

                        The Nuclear Generator Controller is a generator which uses Nuclear items (Uranium Bars) to
                        make energy. It needs to be above a block named the <a href="#cooler">Cooler</a> to work. To
                        avoid overheating it, you must put water into the Cooler with a <a href="#water_pump">Water
                        Pump</a> that needs to be placed next to the Cooler. If the Nuclear Generator Controller
                        explodes, it has 25% chance to spawn a <a ref="#singularity">Singularity</a> which will
                        evolve into a Black Hole.

                        The Teleporter is a block that teleports you to another Teleporter, in another location. To
                        use it, you need to do a right click with a <a href="items.html#teleport_saver">Teleport

                        button to link the coordinates. There is even a button to delete the coordinates when you
                        use the Teleporter! (If you're using the Teleporter at the spawn to teleport to your secret
                        base, for example) <br/> You can find a video that shows how the Teleporter works <a

                        place it, the Teleporter will be able to teleport you in every dimension. To do that, all
                        you need is to enter the dimension ID in the Dimension Linker and click the button to save
                        it. Then if you put the right coordinates in your Teleporter and that a Teleporter exists in
                        the dimension entered and coordinates in the Teleporter, you'll be teleported!

                        The Nuclear Bomb is a bomb using nuclear fuel to explode. To explode, the slots need to be
                        filled in two ways: a nuclear bar in the left slot and a dual nuclear bar in the right slot,
                        or a dual nuclear bar in the left slot and a quad nuclear bar in the right slot.
                        Furthermore, the bomb explosion can be triggered in two different ways: by dropping the bomb
                        over 5 blocks high or with a right-click on it, like a TNT. You can find a video that shows
                        how the Nuclear Bomb works <a href="videos.html#nuclear_bomb">right here.</a>
